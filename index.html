    "summary": "This work explores the historical development of the concept of \"sexuality\" as a discursive construct in Western societies. It argues that sexuality is not a natural given, but rather a product of power relations and social norms that emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries, primarily through institutions like confession and medical discourse. The book examines how sex became an object of knowledge, surveillance, and control, leading to the proliferation of diverse sexual categories and practices, and how this process ultimately served to reinforce existing power structures rather than to liberate individuals."

The author argues that what we perceive as 'madness' is largely a social construct, evolving through different historical epochs and reflecting the power dynamics and societal norms of each era."
